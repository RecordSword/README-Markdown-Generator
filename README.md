# README Generator
A program that gives the user prompts in order to generate a README for all their programs. This will be a useful too in order to have a user create their readme's in a uniform manner and ensure they do not forget any information.
## Installation
npm install
## How to use the Application
The application prompts the user with questions from a Node package. The application then creates and appends the responses from the user to a document called README.md. This is a generic document that most README's utilise.
